# Ryerson-Projects
Notable projects and assignments done as a part of my MSc (Data Science &amp; Analytics) Program at Ryerson University.

- Deep Learning Final Project:
  - Worked with another student to test the effectiveness of iconic architectures (VGG-16, ResNet, InceptionV3) in creating a model that could accurately predict images in the CIFAR-10 Image Dataset.
