# **Ryerson-Projects**
Notable projects and assignments done as a part of my MSc (Data Science &amp; Analytics) Program at Ryerson University.

## CIFAR10 Image Classification with Iconic Architectures:
- Worked with another student to test the effectiveness of iconic architectures (VGG-16, ResNet, InceptionV3) to accurately predict images in the CIFAR-10 Image Dataset.
- **Python** Libraries used: **TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Scikit-Image**\


## MRI Image Classification Model (In Progress)
- Creating a deep learning model to predict whether or not patients have Alzheimer's Disease based on MRI Images. The model is distinct from others because it actually shows the reasoning of why the model chooses the class that it does; the model has a built-in interpretability measure called the ProtoPNet layer, which is adapted from https://github.com/cfchen-duke/ProtoPNet
- **Python** Libraries used: **TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-Image**

## Simple Shakespeare Search Engine
- Program is able to take a query as input and return the most comparable lines from a predetermined Shakespearean text by calculating tf-idf scores.
- Languages Used: **pySpark, HDFS, SQL**
